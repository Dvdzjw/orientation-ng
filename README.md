# orientation-ng
Next generation orientation engine running in browsers.

The goal of this project is to port the long-existing (a.k.a. crappy) [Flash-based orientation engine](https://github.com/WorldIsMonkey/wim-ori-con) to browsers in order to achieve maximum portability, maintainability and expandability using latest web technologies.

ETA May 2019. Needs more manpower.
